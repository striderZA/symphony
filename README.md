# Symphony

Symphony turns project work into isolated, autonomous implementation runs, allowing teams to manage
work instead of supervising coding agents.

_In this [demo video](.github/media/symphony-demo.mp4), Symphony monitors a Linear board for work and spawns agents to handle the tasks. The agents complete the tasks and provide proof of work: CI status, PR review feedback, complexity analysis, and walkthrough videos. When accepted, the agents land the PR safely. Engineers do not need to supervise Codex; they can manage the work at a higher level._

## Running Symphony

### Requirements

Symphony works best in codebases that have adopted
[harness engineering](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/). Symphony is the next step --
moving from managing coding agents to managing work that needs to get done.

### Option 1. Make your own

Tell your favorite coding agent to build Symphony in a programming language of your choice:

> Implement Symphony according to the following spec:
> https://github.com/openai/symphony/blob/main/SPEC.md

### Option 2. Use a reference implementation

- **Python** — `python/` directory. See [python/README.md](python/README.md) for setup instructions.
  - asyncio-native, FastAPI dashboard, Jinja2 prompt rendering, 100+ tests.
- **Elixir** — `elixir/` directory. See [elixir/README.md](elixir/README.md) for setup instructions.
  - Elixir/OTP with Phoenix LiveView dashboard.

You can also ask your favorite coding agent to help with the setup:

> Set up Symphony for my repository based on
> https://github.com/openai/symphony/blob/main/python/README.md
